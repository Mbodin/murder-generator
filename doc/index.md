This folder contains documentation about the program.
The documentation is divided into four kinds of documenting documents:
- [tutorials](./tutorials) contains light tutorials to start writing scenario elements,
- [explanations](./explanations) contains more documentation to understand how the program and each of its commands works,
- [howto](./howto) contains very specific goal-oriented how-to to help when writing specific elements,
- [references](./references) contains more technical references.
Here follows a list of all available documentation.

# Tutorials

- [basic.md](./tutorials/basic.md) for a basic tutorial on how to write a simple element.

# Explanations

- [memory.md](./explanations/memory.md) explains what is the memory model used by the program.
- [language.md](./explanations/language.md) explains how grammar elements are defined.
- [elements.md](./explanations/elements.md) explains how scenario elements are defined, and [advanced.md](./explanations/advanced.md) describes advanced features of scenario elements.
- [names.md](./explanations/names.md) explains how the name files work.

# How-to

- [How to ensure that a character is older than another](./howto/age.md),
- [How to provide attributes or events to all players](./howto/all.md),
- [How to space two events](./howto/space.md).

# References

Actually, most of the code-related reference can be found in `.mli` files in the [src](../src) folder.
In addition, the following are available:
- [grammar.md](./references/grammar.md) describes the grammar of the data files.
- [structure.md](./references/structure.md) explains how the source code of the program is structured.
- [translations.md](./references/translations.md) explains how the file [translations.json](../web/translations.json) works.

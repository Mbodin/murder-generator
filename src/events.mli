(** Build a kind from an attribute (meaning that this event provides
 * such an attribute). **)

(** Similar than [kind_of_attribute], but for contacts.
 * The target characters is taken as argument. **)

(** A function converting kind to string, for debugging purposes. **)

(** The structure of an event.
 * This structure stores all the needed information to describe the event,
 * but lacks any mention of its date and dependencies.
 * See the History module for a richer type.
 * Events are parameterised by the kind of characters. **)
type 'character t = {
    event_id : Id.t
      (** A unique identifier for a particular event.
       * Note that this identifier is only used in this structure.
       * In particular, the event identifiers used in the History module
       * are not the same ones.
       * This number is conserved during instantiations: each event
       * instantiation thus shares the same identifier. **) ;
    event_phantom : bool
      (** Whether this element is a phantom event, that is an event with
       * no description, which is not displayed in the event list.
       * Such events are useful to create empty buffer areas
       * in the life of characters. **) ;
    event_blocking : bool
      (** Whether this element is blocking, that is, whether it prevents
       * other events from happening at the same time. **) ;
    event_type : event_type
      (** Two events with the same event type can’t simultaneously
       * involve the same player. **) ;

(** Comparing the whole structure [t] can take some time.

 * due to a lot of invariants in the program.
 * This function only compares the relevant fields. **)

(** Given an event, return its list of attendees. **)
val get_attendees_list : 'character t -> 'character list

(** Provides a recoverable identifier for an event. **)
val print_event : 'a t -> string

(** Given an instantiation of characters, instantiate an event. **)
val instantiate : ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a t -> 'b t option

(** This is kind of a silly function, but we need it in the Element module
 * to quickly evaluate whether a given character can be instantiated as a
 * particular character in an element in general (and in particuar, in a
 * particular event).
 * To do this, we first have to evaluate which character may be instantiated
 * in each slot, only considering its particular constraints before
 * considering the global ones.
 * This enables to filter out in a first pass characters that obviously
 * can’t be instantiated by a particular event before considering each
 * possibilities in an exponential way.
 * This function projects a partial event to an event… pretending that it
 * only features one character.
 * This event is such that if the full event applies, then the projection
 * also applies (but the projection might apply even if the full event does
 * not).
 * The first argument is the local name of the character and the second its
 * instantiation.
 * The translation part of this event is not to be used. **)
